Finding Internships.
</h1>
<hr>

<br>

<p class="mainText">
 These organisations offer several overseas placements and are one of the few possibilities available for work in developing countries.Positions for these type of organisations are generally designated as <b>volunteer</b> or <b>service</b> positions, rather than internships.
</p>
<p class="mainText">
The organisations range from secular such as <b>Amigos de las Americas</b> or <b>WorldTeach</b>, to various religious-sponsored groups. Though several religious groups are insisting on affiliation, others, such as the <b>Brethren</b> or the <b>American Friend Service Committee</b>, do not find the idea of affiliation appealing.
</p>

<p class="mainText">
Short term placements, which have a duration of less than a year, often charge fees, or at the best provide boarding. Very less long term placements provide for all the expenses of the volunteer, most notably the <b>Peace Corps</b>,which is an U.S. government program that funds positions with host country voluntary organisations.The possible benefit of the <b>volunteer</b> positions is the deferment of educational loan repayments during the volunteer assignment.
