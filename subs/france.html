France
</h1>

<p class="mainText">
France is one of those countries that's popular year-round, and arguably most popular during the summer 
(despite the fact that it can get roastingly hot and it feels like every other tourist on the planet is in the city with you). 
But savvy travelers know that by shifting their trip plans by just a couple months they can experience a city that's far less crowded, 
much less sticky-hot, and no less beautiful or charming.</p>

<p class="mainText">
Because France is popular year-round, as mentioned above, there isn't what you'll really call a "low season" as far as prices go. But while prices won't drop as far as they might in truly seasonal vacation spots, they do drop a bit outside the peak summer season - and it's in the off-season that you're much more likely to find special discount fares. So you're more likely to save money on your France Airfare by traveling in the Spring, although prices will tend to go up as you get later in the season. For the best prices, book in March or early April.</p>
