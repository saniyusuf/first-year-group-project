Where To Go For An Internship?

<p class="mainText">
Here at The Ideal Undergraduate, we have managed to find internship allocations that not only pertain to a single field of interest.
	We for example help attain internships that allow our Computer Science Undergraduates to work for or under sporting firms or organisations. Help generating reports and updating minor databases and at the same time allows the student/intern interact with the world of sports.

These various internships vary in length and hour/time of service depending on the time applied for. Summer internships for example are longer, more intense and therefore require more effort and commitment.  There are also internships that are carried out during and through the school year and these are usually during weekend or days off but in some cases are structured according to the individual`s timetable or times of classes.

<p class="mainText">
We very most of all try not to structure internships that interfere with student`s studies or ways of life. We keep all our internships flexible to time.
	We provide internships both in and around the city of London. We would mostly like for all our students to be based in London but some situations do not allow for such. In cases of summer internships, our partners in both the United States and Australia have reserved spaces for interested summer interns.
