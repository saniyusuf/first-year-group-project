Internships for credit require that the experience is strongly related to an academic discipline to be deemed credit worthy. The main question is determining the value of the internship experience in a higher education context. Internships that are primarily clerical or mechanical do not qualify for academic credit. Students looking to do an internship for credit usually need to have an academic sponsor to oversee and set criteria for the internship.

To meet the academic component of the internship, students may be required to complete a journal, essay, or presentation during or immediately after the internship to illustrate the knowledge and skills they learned over the course of the semester.</p>
