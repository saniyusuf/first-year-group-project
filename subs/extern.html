Externships are very similar to internships but only of a much shorter duration. Another common name for externship is job shadowing. Although these opportunities may only consist of one day to several weeks, they tend to offer participants a bird`s eye view of what it`s actually like working in a particular career field as well as providing some professional contacts for future networking.
