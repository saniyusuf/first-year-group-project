Chile: As the strongest economy of the region, Chile offers both a culturally rich and professionally engaging opportunity for a summer internship. Chile`s capital city is host to many multinational corporations regional headquarters, including LAN Airlines, KPMG, and Shell. With the sky-scraping Andes and picturesque Chilean coastline just minutes away, Santiago is the perfect place to spend your summer.

Through an internship placement you will get to know the Chilean professional life while you also learn Spanish. You will be just one step closer to building up your professional future. Placements are available in Santiago and they are non-paid so you don't need to apply for a workers VISA.

You will also get to mingle with the locals and absorb a bit of their culture, maybe even picking up one or two things that you can bring back home. The internship opportunities available here are limited as this is a rather sort after location, and also because a rather high number of our placement partners are all into internship with pay.
