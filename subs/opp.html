Internships are a great way to meet people in your field. Even if you have skill, knowing people never hurts. An internship allows you to meet people who might help you land a career later on and give you the contacts in the industry you`re trying to break into.
</p>

<p class="mainText">
Plus, references from people in the business will really add credence to your application. Many companies and business owners realize that internships provide them the early opportunity to gauge the talents of a new generation of workers and, in many cases, sell themselves to the students as a quality place to commence their careers after graduation.
